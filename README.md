# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System

### AES-256 Encryption + OTP Verification

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Secure File Sharing System** designed to safely upload and share sensitive files over the internet.
Files are encrypted using **AES-256 encryption** before storage, ensuring that even if the server is compromised, the data remains unreadable.

Access to shared files is protected using **OTP-based verification**, allowing **only the intended receiver** to download the file securely.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional file sharing systems:

* Store files in plain or weakly protected formats
* Allow anyone with a link to download files
* Are vulnerable to server breaches and data leaks

This project solves these issues by combining **encryption, authentication, and access control**.

---

## ✅ Solution

The system enforces multiple security layers:

* Strong encryption for files at rest
* Secure OTP verification for downloads
* Expiring links and one-time access
* Temporary decryption only during download

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

### 👤 Sender

1. Registers / logs into the system
2. Uploads a file
3. File is immediately encrypted using AES-256
4. Encrypted file is stored on the server
5. Generates a secure share link
6. Shares link with receiver

### 👥 Receiver

1. Opens secure download link
2. Receives a 6-digit OTP
3. Enters OTP for verification
4. File is decrypted **in memory**
5. File is downloaded
6. Link becomes invalid after use

## 🗄️ Database

* SQLite database used for simplicity
* Database file is auto-generated at runtime
* Database files are excluded from version control for security

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes an internal test script to verify:

* User registration & login
* File encryption
* Secure sharing
* OTP verification
* File decryption

File:

```
verify_migration.py
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Real email/SMS OTP integration
* Role-based access control
* Cloud storage (AWS S3 / GCP)
* File access logs
* QR-code based secure sharing
* Multi-factor authentication
